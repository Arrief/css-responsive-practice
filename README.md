### Responsive Design Practice

The goals of this challenge were:
- style the webpage as closely as possible after the png-model (minus the icons)
- have it behave responsively when displayed on various screen sizes
- add a little gimmick by use of a media query: the buttons "Monthly" & "Annual" switch colors on smaller screens
